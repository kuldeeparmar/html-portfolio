        In Supreme: The Story of the Year, the superhero Supreme, as comic book author Ethan Crane, draws the adventures
        of Omniman. Omni-man's secret identity is Spencer Samson, with love interests Linda Lake and Lyra Lemuria.
        Later, supervillain Cyber-Zerk attacks Supreme's place of work in search of Omniman, assuming the comic to be
        accurate to life, and kidnap Omniman's creator and writer Diana Dane in an attempt to draw Omniman out,
        subsequently mistaking Supreme for Omniman. Later, Supreme encounters a real-life version of the Dazzle Comics
        Omniman in his office. After questioning their respective existences and accusing the other to be fictional,
        Omniman and Supreme decide to demonstrate each other's powers in a brawl, with Diana helping Supreme by
        providing background on Omniman's powers. Ultimately, after breaking character, 'Omniman' reveals to himself to
        be the inter-dimensional Szazs, the Sprite Supreme, having imitated Supreme's Omniman in an attempt to win the
        Impolympics.

        Following a multiversal war and a subsequent "revision" of Earth's history in Erik Larsen's Supreme, set during
        the events of Invincible, the real Omni-Man faces an 'evil' Supreme after viciously beating Suprema into a coma
        and goes on a killing spree, murdering criminals to re-establish his position as the most powerful superhero on
        the planet, while Dane, the "modern" Supreme and other surviving Supremes of the Supremacy, having been stripped
        of their superpowers, adjust to their helplessness in ending "mean" Supreme's rampage. After bringing their
        fight to the moon, knocking the "mean" Supreme unconscious, Omni-Man is surprised when the "mean" Supreme is
        captured by Khromium, while on Earth, Dane and Supreme are amazed to see a real-life version of their character
        brought to life, after finding Dazzle Comics to no longer exist.
